- I primarily recreate music using the Fire Emblem: the Sacred Stones (FE8) soundfont for insertion
- Most of my covers are from other FE games but I occasionally branch out different games/media
- I am willing to take requests, and I am easily reached through Discord - falkion2040  
- Other than that, I have very limited experience in coding outside of classes and engineering research
